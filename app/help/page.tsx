          <p>Throughout the analysis, you will see scores from 0 to 100. Here is what they mean:</p>
          
          <div className="score-guide">

                <strong>Excellent</strong>
                <p>Outstanding performance. The agent handled this aspect very well. No immediate action needed - this is behavior to reinforce and celebrate.</p>
              </div>

            <div className="score-row good">

              <div className="score-meaning">
                <strong>Good / Needs Improvement</strong>
                <p>Acceptable performance with room for improvement. The agent is doing okay but could benefit from targeted coaching on specific areas.</p>

            <p>If an agent scores <strong>72 in Empathy</strong>, it means they showed decent understanding of the customer&apos;s feelings, but there were moments where they could have been more supportive or acknowledging. Check the coaching feedback for specific suggestions.</p>

        <div className="help-content">
          <p>These are objective measurements about how the conversation flowed. They help identify patterns and issues.</p>
          
          <div className="metric-explainer">
            <div className="metric-item">
              <h4>🗣️ Talk Ratio</h4>
              <div className="metric-visual">
                <div className="ratio-example">
                  <span className="agent-bar">Agent 45%</span>
                  <span className="customer-bar">Customer 45%</span>

                </div>
              </div>
              <p><strong>What it shows:</strong> How much time each person spent talking during the call.</p>
              <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> If the agent talks too much (60%+), they may not be listening to the customer. If they talk too little (30% or less), they may not be providing enough value.</p>
              <p><strong>Ideal range:</strong> Agent should speak 40-50% of the time.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="metric-item">
              <h4>❓ Questions Asked</h4>
              <p><strong>Total Questions:</strong> How many questions the agent asked during the call.</p>
              <p><strong>Open Questions:</strong> Questions that require detailed answers. Example: &ldquo;How have you been feeling lately?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What brings you in today?&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Closed Questions:</strong> Questions with yes/no answers. Example: &ldquo;Is the pain constant?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Did you take the medication?&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Good agents ask more open questions to understand the customer deeply, then use closed questions to confirm specific details.</p>
              <p><strong>Ideal:</strong> More open questions than closed questions, especially early in the call.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="metric-item">
              <h4>🔇 Interruptions</h4>
              <p><strong>What it shows:</strong> How many times someone started speaking while the other person was still talking.</p>
              <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Frequent agent interruptions suggest poor listening skills and can frustrate customers. Customer interruptions may indicate confusion or strong emotions.</p>
              <p><strong>Ideal:</strong> Less than 3 interruptions by the agent per call.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="metric-item">
              <h4>⏱️ Response Time</h4>
              <p><strong>Average Response Time:</strong> How quickly the agent responds after the customer finishes speaking.</p>
              <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Too fast (under 1 second) suggests the agent isn&apos;t fully listening. Too slow (over 4 seconds) creates awkward silences.</p>
              <p><strong>Ideal:</strong> 1-3 seconds response time.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="metric-item">
              <h4>🏃 Words Per Minute (WPM)</h4>
              <p><strong>What it shows:</strong> Speaking speed of both the agent and customer.</p>
              <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Speaking too fast (180+ WPM) makes it hard for customers to follow. Speaking too slow (under 100 WPM) can seem disengaged.</p>
              <p><strong>Ideal:</strong> 120-150 WPM for professional conversations.</p>

        <div className="help-content faq-list">
          <div className="faq-item">
            <h4>Will I get the same results if I analyze the same call twice?</h4>
            <p>Yes! The AI uses very consistent settings (low temperature), so analyzing the same call multiple times will produce nearly identical results. This ensures fair and consistent evaluations.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="faq-item">
            <h4>Can the AI understand Hindi and mixed languages?</h4>
            <p>Yes. The AI understands English, Hindi, and mixed Hindi-English (Hinglish) conversations, which is common in Indian healthcare and business contexts.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="faq-item">
            <h4>How accurate are the predictions?</h4>
            <p>Predictions are based on patterns in conversation and are generally reliable, but they are estimates, not guarantees. Use them to prioritize actions, not as absolute truths.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="faq-item">
            <h4>What if the transcription has errors?</h4>
            <p>AI transcription is highly accurate but not perfect, especially with poor audio quality, heavy accents, or background noise. Always use the audio player to verify critical parts.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="faq-item">
            <h4>How long does analysis take?</h4>
            <p>Typically 30-60 seconds per call, depending on the length. Longer calls take more time.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="faq-item">
            <h4>Can I export the analysis?</h4>
            <p>Yes! You can export the full analysis as JSON, the transcript as text, or the coaching report separately. Use the export buttons on the analysis page.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="faq-item">
            <h4>What file formats are supported?</h4>
            <p>Most common audio formats: MP3, WAV, M4A, AAC, OGG, FLAC, MPEG, and WebM. Files should be under 20MB.</p>
